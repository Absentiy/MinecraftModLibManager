# MinecraftModLibManager
A simple mod manager for minecraft.
It has some basic features:
- Add mod
- Delete mod
- See its description and more
- Enable/disable mod

To use "find unused libs" feature you must mark all your mods on your own.
It means that you must specify for each mod what it is. (Addon, Library or Normal mod)

Future plans:
- Show more info about mods
- Improve mod adding
- Maybe support mod updating
